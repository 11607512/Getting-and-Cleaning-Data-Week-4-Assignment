## The variables in the tidy data

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

## The data were averaged based on assigned activity group.
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

## The tidy data contains 6 rows (averaged based on activity) and 68 columns (66 variables and activity labels).
